# Smart Greenhouse React Web App

The Smart Greenhouse is an innovative system that aims to improve the efficiency and productivity of greenhouses. It does this by continuously monitoring and adjusting the conditions inside the greenhouse to ensure that they are optimal for plant growth. This web app provides an interface for users to remotely control the Smart Greenhouse, view current and historical data on various parameters, and optimize the greenhouse environment.
